%\section{Conditional Probability}
% Section and subsections will appear in the presentation overview
% and table of contents.
\begin{frame}{Review}
\begin{itemize}
\item Random experiment, sample point, sample space
\item Probability
\item Events, union and intersection, mutually exclusive events, complementary event
\item Additive rule
\item Conditional probability, multiplicative rule
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Statistical Independence}
A and B are independent events if the occurrence of A doesnâ€™t change the probability that B occurs. Formally,
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\pr(A \cap B)=\pr(A)\pr(B)$
    \item Equivalently, $\pr(A \mid B)=\pr(A)$
    \item Equivalently, $\pr(B \mid A)=\pr(B)$
\end{itemize}

\vspace{\stretch{0.5}}
Example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are mutually exclusive events independent?
    \item Flip two coins, A =``the first coin shows Heads'', B = ``The second coin shows Heads''.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Statistical Independence}
Statistical independence simplifies calculation of probabilities:
$$\pr(A\cap B) =\pr(A)\pr(B).$$

\vspace{\stretch{0.5}}
Example: Suppose that you flip two fair coins. Let A =``the first coin shows Heads'', 
B = ``The second coin shows Heads''. Find the probability of getting Heads on both coins, i.e.\ find 
$\pr(A \cap B)$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bayes' Rule}
    A tool to relate $\pr(A\mid B)$ to $\pr(B | A)$:
    $$ \pr(B\mid A) = \frac{\pr(A\mid B) \pr(B)}{\pr(A)}$$%, \quad \pr(A\mid B) = \frac{\pr(B\mid A) \pr(A)}{\pr(B)}$$ 

\vspace{\stretch{0.5}}
Example: With probability 0.15, a person will pass the job interview for a Data Analyst position. 
Among those who passed the interview, 60\% had taken college courses in Statistics. It
happens also that 30\% of all those who interviewed had college courses in
Statistics. Find the probability that a person with college courses in Statistics
will pass the job interview.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bayes' Rule}
    More generally, given $k$ mutually exclusive events $B_1,B_2,\dots,B_k$ such that $\pr(B_1) + \pr(B_2) + \dots + \pr(B_k)=1$, then
    \begin{align*}
        \pr(B_i \mid A) & = \frac{\pr(A \cap  B_i) }{\pr(A)}\\
                        & =
        \frac{\pr(A\mid B_i) \pr(B_i)}
        {\pr(A\mid B_1)\pr(B_1) + \dots + \pr(A\mid B_k) \pr(B_k)}
    \end{align*}

\vspace{\stretch{0.5}}
    Example: Suppose that 1\% of population have a special disease. A blood test detects the disease with probability 0.95 when it is present, 
    but also falsely detects it when it's not present with probability 0.02. Test shows that a person has the disease; what is the probability that he indeed has it?

%\section{Permutations and Combinations}
\ignore{
\begin{frame}{General Approach to Probability Problems}
    General steps to computing the probability of an event:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item    Define the random experiment.
        \item    List the sample points of the experiment (i.e.\, identify the sample space).
        \item    Assign probabilities to the sample points.
        \item    Determine the set of sample points contained in the event of interest.
        \item    Sum the probabilities of the sample points in the event to get the probability.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
}

\begin{frame}{Counting}
In some probability problems, all sample points are equally likely.  Then 

$$\pr(A)=\frac{\text{no. of sample points in } A}{\text{no. of sample points in } \Omega}$$

\begin{itemize}
    \item In simple experiments, we can list out all the sample points. 
        Example: flip a coin twice, then $\Omega=\{HH,HT,TH,TT\}$.
    \item In more complex experiments, we need to use counting rules to help us.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

        \item Example: A club consists of five members. How many ways are there of selecting three officers: president, secretary and treasurer?
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{\stretch{0.5}}

    \begin{block}{Combinations}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Multiplication Rule}
Suppose $k$ experiments are performed in order, where the first experiment has $n_1$ outcomes, the second  experiment has $n_2$ outcomes, ..., the $k$-th experiment has $n_k$ outcomes. The total number of different outcomes is the product
$$n_1 \cdot n_2 \cdots n_k.$$

%You have $k$ sets of different elements, $n_1$ in the first set, $n_2$ in the second set, ...,  and $n_k$ in the $k$-th set.  Suppose you want to form a sample of $k$ elements by taking one element from each of the $k$ sets.  The number of different samples that can be formed is the product $$n_1 \cdot n_2 \cdots n_k.$$

\begin{frame}{Permutations vs Combinations}
    Permutations are for lists (order matters) and combinations are for groups (order does not matter). They are related by
    $$ P(n,k) = C(n,k)P(k,k).$$
    
                \vspace{\stretch{0.5}}
    Interpretation: 
    \begin{align*}
        (\text{no. of perms}) &= (\text{no. of combs} ) 
                                   \times (\text{ no. of perms within each comb}).
    \end{align*}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Permutations vs Combinations}
