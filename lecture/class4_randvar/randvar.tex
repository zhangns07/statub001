%\question Suppose we pick 4 balls out of an urn with 12 red balls and 8 black
%balls.  What is the probability of $B = \text{``We get two balls of each
%color''}$?
%
%\begin{solution}
%The number of ways to pick 4 balls out of 20 is $\binom{20}{4}$.
%
%We use the multiplication rule as to count the number of ways to pick two
%balls of each color.  The sequence of experiments is (1) pick two red balls
%from the $12$, then (2) pick two black balls from the $8$.  There are
%$\binom{12}{2}$ ways to perform the first experiment, and $\binom{8}{2}$ to
%perform the second experiment, so there are $\binom{12}{2} \binom{8}{2}$
%total.
%
%Finally,
%\begin{align*}
%  P(B) &=
%    \frac{\#\{\text{picks with two balls of each color}\}}
%         {\#\{\text{picks with four balls\}}} \\
%       &= \frac{\binom{12}{2} \binom{8}{2}}{\binom{20}{4}}

\question \textbf{New York state lotto.}  You pick six of the numbers 1 through
54, and then in a televised drawing six of the numbers are selected.  If all
six of your numbers are selected then you win a share of the first place
prize.  If five or four of your numbers are selected you win a share of the
second or third prize.

\begin{parts}
\part How many ways are there to select 6 numbers for the lotto ticket?

\begin{solution}
\[
  \binom{54}{6}
  = \frac{54 \cdot 53 \cdot 52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50 \cdot 49}
         {6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}
  = 25827165

\[
  1
\]
\end{solution}

\vspace{\stretch{1}}


\part What is the probability of selecting a first prize number?


\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
   P(\text{first prize})
     &= \frac{\#\{\text{lotto tickets that match all six numbers}\}}
         {\#\{\text{lotto tickets\}}} \\
     &= \frac{1}{\binom{54}{6}} \\
     &= 1 / 25827165 \\
     &= 0.000004\%
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\vspace{\stretch{1}}

\part What is the probability of selecting a second prize number?
\begin{solution}
How many lotto tickets have five matches and one mismatch from our pick?
Consider the following sequence of experiments for enumerating all such
possibilities: (1) pick $5$ numbers out of our six to match; (2) pick $1$
number to mismatch.  There are $\binom{6}{5}$ possible outcomes for experiment
(1), and $\binom{48}{1}$ possible outcomes for experiment (2).  (Note that $48
= 54 - 6$; there are $48$ numbers in the range 1--54 which aren't on our lotto
ticket.)  Thus,
\begin{align*}
   P(\text{second prize})
    &= \frac{\#\{\text{lotto tickets that match exactly five numbers}\}}
         {\#\{\text{lotto tickets\}}} \\
     &= \frac{\binom{6}{5}\binom{48}{1}}{\binom{54}{6}}.
\end{align*}

The computation for third prize is similar to the computation for second
prize:

\begin{align*}
   P(\text{third prize})
    &= \frac{\#\{\text{lotto tickets that match exactly four numbers}\}}
         {\#\{\text{lotto tickets\}}} \\
     &= \frac{\binom{6}{4}\binom{48}{2}}{\binom{54}{6}}.
\end{align*}

\question \textbf{Quality assurance.}  Suppose we have a batch of $100$ light bulbs,
which contains $5$ defective bulbs.  If we pick $10$ for testing, what is the
probability that no bulbs in the sample are defective?  We can answer this
question in three steps.

\begin{parts}

\part How many ways are there of picking $10$ bulbs for testing out of $100$?

\part What is the probability that there are no defective bulbs in your sample
of $10$?

\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}

    &= \frac{\binom{95}{10}}{\binom{100}{10}} \\
    &= 58\%.

\question \textbf{The Birthday Problem.} A class has 20 students.  What is the probability that at least
two students have the same birthday?  Assume that each person in the class was
assigned a random birthday between January 1 and December 31.

\begin{solution}
Assume that everyone in the class is randomly assigned a birthday, which
corresponds to number between 1 and 365 representing the day of the year.
It turns out to be much easier to compute the probability using the complement
rule, as
\[
  \Pr(\text{at least 2 people have the same birthday})
  = 1 - \Pr(\text{all 20 birthdays are different}).
\]

We use counting rules to compute the probability that all 20 birthdays are different. 
We first compute the size of sample space. That is $365^{20}$.

Next, we compute the number of ways to assign 365 birthdays to 20 students, such that no two students can have the same birthday.
That is $P(365,20)=\frac{365!}{345!}$.

Thus the probability of all 20 birthdays are different is
$$\frac{P(365,20)}{365^{20}} = \frac{365}{365}\cdot \frac{364}{365}\cdot\frac{363}{365}\cdots \frac{365-19}{365}.$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item You pay \$6 to flip a coin.
\item If the coin lands heads, you get \$10; otherwise, you get nothing.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{parts}

\part Would you play this game?  Why or why not?

\begin{solution}
It will usually be beneficial to play the game when our expected winnings are
positive.  In this situation, if we play the game many times, then in the long
run we will make a profit.
\end{solution}

randomly-chosen member of the class drinks on a typical day.  There is a
22\% chance that the student has one cup, a 16\% chance that the student has
two cups, a 16\% chance that the student has three cups, an 11\% chance that
the student has four cups, and a 3\% chance that the student has five cups.
Also, there is a 32\% chance that the student doesn't drink any coffee.

\part What is the interpretation of the expectation of $X$?

\begin{solution}
The long-run sample mean.  If we performed the random experiment upon which
$X$ is measured many times, getting a different value of $X$ each time, then
the sample mean would be very close to the expectation of $X$.
In particular, if every day we sample a student from the class and measure how
many cups of coffee they drink, then after awhile, the average number of cups
of coffee will be close to the expectation (1.61).

\question This is a continuation of problem~\ref{ques:rv-coffee}.

\begin{parts}

\part Find $\var(X)$ and $\sd(X)$, the variance and standard deviation of $X$,
the number of cups of coffee that a random student from the class drinks on a
typical day.


\begin{solution}

The standard deviation of $X$ is given by
\[

\]
\end{solution}

\vspace{\stretch{1}}

\part What is the interpretation of the standard deviation of $X$?

\begin{solution}
The long-run sample standard deviation.  If we performed the random experiment upon which

the sample standard deviation would be very close to the standard deviation of
$X$.  
In particular, if every day we sample a student from the class and measure how

deviation of the number of cups of coffee will be close to the 1.48.

\question Consider the following game:
\begin{enumerate}
\item You pay \$6 to pick a card from a standard 52-card deck.
\item If the card is a diamond ($\diamondsuit$), you get \$22; if the card is a
heart ($\heartsuit$), you get \$6; otherwise, you get nothing.
\end{enumerate}
Perform the following calculations to decide whether or not you would play
this game.

\begin{parts}

\part \label{part:rv-cardsuit-game-pdf} Let $W$ be the random variable equal
to the amount of money you win from playing the game.  If you lose money, $W$
will be negative.  Find the PDF of $W$.

\begin{solution}
The sample points corresponding to the suit of the card are $\spadesuit$,
$\heartsuit$, $\clubsuit$, and $\diamondsuit$; each of these has probability
$\tfrac{1}{4}$.  The values of the random variable $W$
corresponding to the sample points are as follow:

$\spadesuit$ & -6 \\
$\heartsuit$ & 0 \\
$\clubsuit$ & -6 \\

of $W$ is
\begin{align*}
  \mu
  &= (.50)(-6) + (.25)(0) + (.25)(16) \\
  &= 1.
\end{align*}
On average, we win \$1 every time we play the game.
\end{solution}

\vspace{\stretch{1}}


\part What is the standard deviation of $W$?

\begin{solution}

Using the PDF computed in part~(\ref{part:rv-cardsuit-game-pdf}), and the expected value
computed in part~(\ref{part:rv-cardsuit-game-expect}), we compute the variance
of $W$ as
\begin{align*}
  \sigma^2
  &= (.50)(-6 - 1)^2 + (.25)(0 - 1)^2 + (.25)(16 - 1)^2 \\
  &= 81.

Thus, the standard deviation of $W$ is
\[
  \sigma = \sqrt{81} = 9.

\vspace{\stretch{1}}


\part What are the interpretations of the expectation and standard deviation
of $W$?

\begin{solution}
If we played the game many many times, then the average of our winnings over
all times we played would be close to the \$1, and the standard
