\question Suppose that a shipment of 100 fruit crates has 11 crates in which the
fruit shows signs of spoilage.  A quality control inspection selects 8 crates
at random, opens these selected crates, and then counts the number (out of 8)
in which the fruit shows signs of spoilage.  What is the probability that
exactly two crates in the sample show signs of spoilage?



\begin{solution}
Let $X$ be the number of spoiled crates in the sample.  This is a
hypergeometric random variable with $n = 8$ elements in the sample, $N = 100$
elements in the population, and $r = 11$ success elements in the population
(namely, the spoiled crates).  Thus,

\[
  P(X = 2)
    = \frac{\binom{r}{2} \binom{N - r}{n - 2}}{\binom{N}{n}}
    = \frac{\binom{11}{2} \binom{89}{6}}{\binom{100}{8}}
    \approx .171.
\]
\end{solution}
