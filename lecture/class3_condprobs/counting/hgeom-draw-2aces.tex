\question If we draw 5 cards from a 52-card deck, what is the probability of
getting exactly 2 aces?


\begin{solution}
Let $X$ be the number of aces in our hand.  This is a hypergeometric random
variable with $n = 5$ elements in the sample, $N = 52$ elements in the
population, and $r = 4$ success elements in the population (namely,
$A\spadesuit, A\heartsuit, A\clubsuit$, and $A\diamondsuit$).  Thus,

\[
  P(X = 2)
    = \frac{\binom{r}{2} \binom{N - r}{n - 2}}{\binom{N}{n}}
    = \frac{\binom{4}{2} \binom{48}{3}}{\binom{52}{5}}
    \approx .040.
\]
\end{solution}
