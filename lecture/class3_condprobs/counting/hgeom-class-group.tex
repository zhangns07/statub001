\question There are 70 students in enrolled in a course: 40 freshman, 20
sophomores, and 10 juniors.  If you randomly select a group of 4 students,
what is the probability of getting all freshman?


\begin{solution}
Let $X$ be the number of freshmen in the group.  This is a
hypergeometric random variable with $n = 4$ elements in the sample, $N = 70$
elements in the population, and $r = 40$ success elements in the population.
Therefore,
\[
  P(X = 4)
    = \frac{\binom{r}{4} \binom{N - r}{n - 4}}{\binom{N}{n}}
    = \frac{\binom{40}{4} \binom{30}{0}}{\binom{70}{4}}
    \approx .010.
\]
\end{solution}
